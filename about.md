## About

Most of the devices we use in our lives are networked using wireless technology. This course provides an introduction to wireless communication and networking. It covers the fundamental concepts, including signal propagation, modulation, and energy consumption estimation. Building upon these foundational topics, the course explores various layers of the wireless networking stack, including physical, Mac, networking and application layers. These lead to case studies covering commodity wireless standards (like WiFi, Bluetooth), Cellular networks, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Throughout the course, students will participate in tutorials, assignments and hands-on projects, enabling them to apply concepts and develop software prototypes for real IoT devices, thus translating the knowledge acquired into practical scenarios.
